  </summary>

```markdown
# Blacklist Token Model - Mongoose Schema

This  contains a Mongoose schema and model for blacklisting JWT tokens, ensuring that invalidated or revoked tokens are automatically removed after a set period (24 hours).

## Features

- **Token Storage**: Stores blacklisted JWT tokens to prevent their reuse.
- **TTL (Time-To-Live)**: Automatically deletes blacklisted tokens from the database after 24 hours.
- **Uniqueness**: Ensures that each blacklisted token is unique in the collection.
  
## Schema Structure

- **token**: The JWT token that has been blacklisted. This field is required and unique in the collection.
- **createdAt**: The timestamp indicating when the token was blacklisted. This field is automatically set to the current date and time when the token is created.

## TTL (Time-To-Live)

- A TTL index is set on the `createdAt` field to automatically delete documents after 24 hours (86400 seconds). This ensures that blacklisted tokens are removed from the collection after 24 hours, preventing unnecessary storage of invalid tokens.

## Example Use Case

The `BlacklistToken` model can be used to track tokens that have been invalidated (e.g., when a user logs out or when their session is terminated). This helps ensure that a user cannot reuse a token after it has been blacklisted.

## Dependencies

- `mongoose`: ODM for MongoDB, used to define and interact with the MongoDB collection.

<details>
  <summary>
    <h2> /users/profile</h2>
  </summary>


### **Feature**

- **User Profile** retrieval functionality via the `/users/profile` route.
- The route is protected and requires the user to be authenticated via a **JWT token**.
- There are two ways to pass the token:
  - **Via the Authorization header**: Use the format `Bearer ${token}`.
  - **Via a cookie**: The token is stored in a cookie after a successful login.
  
### **Middleware**

The **authentication middleware** is used to validate the JWT token before granting access to the profile route. The middleware checks for the token either in the request header or in the cookies.

```javascript
module.exports.authUser = async(req, res, next) => {
    const token = req.cookies.token || req.headers.authorization.split(' ')[1];
    
    if (!token) {
        res.status(401).json({ message: 'UnAuthorized' });
    }

    try {
        const decode = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
        const user = await userModel.findById(decode._id);
        req.user = user;
        return next();
    } catch (err) {
        return res.status(401).json({ message: 'UnAuthorized' });
    }
}
```

### **Request Method**

- **POST**: `/users/profile`

### **Request Headers**

- **Authorization** (Optional if the token is passed in cookies):
  - Format: `Bearer ${token}`
  
- **Cookie** (Optional if the token is passed in the header):
  - Format: `token=${token}`

### **Response**

#### **200 OK**

Upon successful authentication, the user's profile data will be returned.

```json
{
  "_id": "id",
  "fullname": {
    "firstname": "firstname",
    "lastname": "lastname"
  },
  "email": "email",
  "password": "password"
}
```

#### **Error Responses**

##### **401 Unauthorized**

If the token is missing, invalid, or expired, the response will return a `401 Unauthorized` status.

```json
{
  "message": "UnAuthorized"
}
```

### **Testing**

You can test the profile endpoint using tools like **Postman** or **CURL**.

#### **Example CURL Request (with Authorization Header)**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/users/profile \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}"
```

#### **Example CURL Request (with Cookie)**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/users/profile \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--cookie "token=${token}"
```

### **Notes**

- This route requires the user to be authenticated via a **JWT token**.
- The token can be passed in the **Authorization header** or in **cookies**.
- If the token is missing, invalid, or expired, the user will receive an `Unauthorized` response (`401` status).
- The response contains the **user profile data** after successful authentication.

---

</details>


<details>
  <summary>
    <h2> /users/logout</h2>
  </summary>

### **Feature**

- **User logout** functionality via the `/users/logout` route.
- Logs out the user by **removing the token** from the client-side cookies.
- It also blacklists the token to ensure it cannot be used again for authentication.

### **Middleware**

The **authentication middleware** (`authUser`) is used to verify the token before the user is logged out. It checks if the token is blacklisted or invalid.

```javascript
module.exports.authUser = async (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.cookies.token || req.headers?.authorization?.split(' ')[1];

  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
  }

  try {
    // Check if the token is blacklisted
    const isBlacklisted = await blacklistTokenModel.findOne({ token });

    if (isBlacklisted) {
      console.log('Token is blacklisted:', isBlacklisted);  // Log the blacklisted token
      return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized Access!' });
    }

    // If token is valid and not blacklisted, proceed to authenticate the user
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    const user = await userModel.findById(decoded._id);
    req.user = user;

    return next();  // Proceed to the logout action
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
}
```

---

### **BlacklistToken Model**

The **`BlacklistToken` model** is responsible for storing blacklisted tokens in the database. These are the tokens that have been invalidated or revoked, ensuring they can no longer be used for authentication.

#### **Schema Overview:**

The schema for the `BlacklistToken` model includes the following fields:

- **token**: A `String` that represents the blacklisted JWT token. It is marked as required and unique, ensuring that each token can only be blacklisted once.
  
- **createdAt**: A `Date` field that represents when the token was added to the blacklist. It has a default value of the current time (`Date.now`), and it is used to set the TTL (Time-to-Live) for the token in the collection.

#### **TTL (Time-To-Live):**

The `createdAt` field is indexed with a TTL of **24 hours**. This means that once a token is added to the blacklist, it will automatically be deleted from the database after 24 hours (86400 seconds).

This TTL feature is enabled using MongoDB's TTL index mechanism. The benefit is that expired tokens are automatically removed from the collection, ensuring that the database does not grow unnecessarily.

#### **Schema Code:**

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Schema for blacklisting token with TTL (Time-To-Live) of 24 hours
const blacklistTokenSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    token: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      unique: true, // Ensures each token is unique in the collection
    },
    createdAt: {
      type: Date,
      default: Date.now, // Default to current time
    },
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

// Create a TTL index to automatically delete documents after 24 hours (86400 seconds)
blacklistTokenSchema.index({ createdAt: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 86400 });

const blacklistTokenModel = mongoose.model('BlacklistToken', blacklistTokenSchema , 'blacklistedtokens');

module.exports = blacklistTokenModel;
```

### **How It Works**

1. When a user logs out, their JWT token is added to the `blacklistedtokens` collection, making it invalid for future authentication requests.
2. The token is stored in the collection with a `createdAt` timestamp.
3. After **24 hours**, the token is automatically deleted from the collection due to the TTL index, meaning the token will only be blacklisted for a limited period.

### **Usage in Middleware**

In the `/users/logout` route, the `blacklistTokenModel` is used to check if a token has been blacklisted before allowing access to the route:

```javascript
const isBlacklisted = await blacklistTokenModel.findOne({ token });
if (isBlacklisted) {
  return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized Access!' });
}
```

This ensures that a blacklisted token cannot be used for logout or future requests, adding an additional layer of security.

---

### **Request Method**

- **GET**: `/users/logout`

### **Response**

#### **200 OK**

Upon successful logout, the server will clear the cookie containing the token and the response will indicate the successful logout.

```json
{
  "message": "Logged out successfully"
}
```

#### **Error Responses**

##### **401 Unauthorized**

If the token is missing, invalid, or already blacklisted:

```json
{
  "message": "Unauthorized"
}
```

### **Testing**

You can test the logout endpoint using tools like **Postman** or **CURL**.

#### **Example CURL Request**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/users/logout \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}"
```

#### **Example CURL Request (with Cookie)**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/users/logout \
--cookie "token=${token}"
```

### **Notes**

- The token will be **removed from the cookies** and **blacklisted** to prevent further use.
- If the token is missing or invalid, the user will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.
- Ensure that the **Authorization header** or the **cookie** is sent with the request in order to authenticate and log out the user.
